# Set Inputs Example

## Overview

The goal of this example project is to test the performance of Engflow's remote execution and caching service for different input sizes. The project contains a genrule that writes a set number of `.txt` files in the `genfile` directory. The content of this files is then read and printed out with the `Reader` class.

## Project Structure

- `java/com/engflow/internship/setinput/genfile`: Directory where the `.txt` files generated by the genrule are stored.
- `java/com/engflow/internship/varyinginputs/main`: Contains the `Main` class which orchestrates the reading process.
- `java/com/engflow/internship/varyinginputs/reader`: Contains the `Reader` class responsible for reading the files.

## Usage

To generate the test files, build the filegroup target:
```sh
bazel build //java/com/engflow/internship/setinput/genfile
```

Then, the program can be run with the following command:

```sh
bazel run //java/com/engflow/internship/varyinginputs/main 
```

To modify the amount of files generated, change the value of the `NUM_FILES` in the `BUILD` file inside the `genfile` directory.
