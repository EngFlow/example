# Example Projects for Performance Testing

## Overview

Welcome to the `internship` folder of the EngFlow examples repository. This folder contains a set of example projects designed to evaluate and benchmark the performance of EngFlow's remote execution and caching services. These projects aim to provide a diverse range of test cases with varying input sizes, numbers of inputs, and execution times. The goal is to generate performance data that can help in understanding how different factors affect the performance of remote build optimization services.

## Purpose

The primary objectives of these example projects are to:

1. **Generate Performance Data**: Create examples with varying complexity to test and gather performance data for EngFlowâ€™s remote caching and execution services.
2. **Benchmark Analysis**: Compare the performance of local versus remote execution and caching to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the service.
3. **Support Automation Development**: Contribute to the development of automation algorithms for resource assignment by providing valuable data on how the size and nature of the builds impact performance.
